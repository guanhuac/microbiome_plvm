# Latent Variable Modeling for the Microbiome

This repository includes all code for simulations, data analysis, and figures in
(give link to paper). The high level commands, corresponding to different
sections, are given in `src/run_all.sh`. To facilitate direct experimentation,
we have also provided a docker image (built using the Dockerfile in `src/`) with
all software requirements preinstalled and this repo copied into the image's
`/home/` directory.

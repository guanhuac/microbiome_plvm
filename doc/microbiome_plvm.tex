\section{Introduction}

Generally, microbiome studies attempt to characterize variation in microbial
abundance profiles across different experimental conditions
\cite{human2012structure}. For example, a study may attempt to describe differences
in microbial commuities between diseased and healthy states or after
deliberately induced perturbations \cite{dethlefsen2011incomplete}.

In the process, there tend to be two complementary difficulties. First, the data
are often high dimensional, measured over several hundreds or thousands of
microbes. Studying patterns at the level of individual microbes is typically
infeasible. Second, it can be important to study microbial abundances in context
of known biological information. For example, it is scientifically meaningful
when a collection of evolutionarily related microbes change in sync with one
another.

\section{Methods}

We now review a few of the statistical modeling techniques that we believe can
be useful building blocks when performing microbiome analysis. Many of these
techniques have been borrowed from text analysis, thinking of the samples by
microbes matrix as a biological analog of the usual document-term matrix. The
idea of transferring these techniques to the microbiome is not new, though its
appropriateness and usefulness has only been explored to a relatively limited
extent \cite{shafiei2015biomico, chen2012estimating, holmes2012dirichlet,
  chen2013variable}.
